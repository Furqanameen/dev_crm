## 🚀 Brevo Webhook Setup Guide

### Your Webhook URL
```
http://localhost:3000/webhooks/brevo
```

### Testing the Webhook Locally
The webhook is working! Here's what you need to do:

## 📋 Step-by-Step Setup:

### 1. **Verify ngrok Email** (for remote testing)
- Go to: https://dashboard.ngrok.com/user/settings  
- Verify your email address
- Then run: `ngrok http 3000`

### 2. **For Production Setup**
Once you deploy to production, use:
```
https://your-domain.com/webhooks/brevo
```

### 3. **Brevo Dashboard Configuration**
1. **Login to Brevo** → **Settings** → **Webhooks**
2. **Add New Webhook**
3. **Enter URL**: Your webhook URL
4. **Select Events**:
   - ✅ `delivered` - When email reaches inbox
   - ✅ `opened` - When recipient opens email  
   - ✅ `clicked` - When recipient clicks links
   - ✅ `bounced` - When email bounces
   - ✅ `spam` - When marked as spam
   - ✅ `blocked` - When sending blocked
   - ✅ `unsubscribed` - When recipient unsubscribes

### 4. **What the Webhook Does**
- ✅ Updates message status to "delivered" when confirmed by Brevo
- 📊 Creates timeline events (opens, clicks, bounces)
- 🚫 Handles unsubscribes automatically
- 📝 Logs all activity for debugging

### 5. **Testing**
The webhook successfully responds with:
```json
{"status":"ok"}
```

### 6. **Monitoring**
Check Rails logs for webhook activity:
```bash
tail -f log/development.log | grep "Brevo webhook"
```

## 🎯 **What This Solves**
After setting up the webhook, your campaigns will show:
- ✅ **Accurate "Delivered" counts** 
- 📈 **Real-time event tracking**
- 📊 **Proper status updates**

The difference between "Sent" (left your system) and "Delivered" (confirmed by Brevo) will be clearly visible!

## 🔧 **Next Steps**
1. Verify your ngrok email
2. Get your public webhook URL (ngrok or production)
3. Configure in Brevo dashboard
4. Send test campaign and watch the status update! 🎉
